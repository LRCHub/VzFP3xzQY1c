She is a creature
Her claws are sharp like a razor
She's true to nature
That's just what happens in nature
They try to cage her
She's like a sleeping sunbather
She's true to nature
That's just what happens in nature

I know what I want
I wanna be myself
Even if it hurts
A-na-na-na-na-na
I know what I want
Does it gross you out?
I don't give a fuck
